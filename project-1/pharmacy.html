        <p class="text-center text-secondary fs-4 m-5">Pharmacy is a blend of science, health care, direct patient contact, technology, ethics, and business. A pharmacist is a highly skilled and trusted medication expert. They know and understand everything there is to know about drugs. Pharmacists undergo extensive education to understand the role that drugs play in different situations. They are familiar with the biochemical makeup of drugs and how that impacts their use, side effects, interactions, and implications of effectiveness. Their role revolves around dispensing prescriptions to patients, conducting health screenings, giving immunizations, and advising on the safe use of medicine. </p>
           <p class="text-center text-secondary fs-4 m-5"> Pharmacists are extremely accessible healthcare professionals who work closely with patients and physicians to determine that the correct medications and dosages are prescribed for each patient. They have very rewarding work, but it is not easy nor should it be taken lightly. Medication errors can be extremely harmful to patients, so individuals interested in becoming a pharmacist must pay close attention to detail.</p>
